# Overview
When I was working as a Product Owner at The Tech Academy, I was tasked with creating a simple landing page for the Advanced JavaScript course.  I went about this by planning out the project.  At that time, we didn't know which front end framework the course was going to use (React, Angular, Vue).  So I started building the landing page with standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the help of some 3rd party libraries like Bootstrap, jQuery, and Masonry.  I used  a combination of a couple reference images of landing pages that I found online.  I treated those reference images as mockups to follow.  After about 8 hours of programming, I was able to make the page that you see here: [Travel Logue](https://advjs-8hr-project.herokuapp.com/)
